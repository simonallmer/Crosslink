  // A trifecta board. Nine nouns stand in a 3x3 grid and the connections are
  // the six straight lines: three rows and three columns. Each line is one
  // sentence about all three of its words, and each line carries its own colour
  // so the six of them can be told apart at a glance. There are no diagonals on
  // this board — a diagonal would have to borrow a colour someone already wears.
  //
  // `tr` is the three row lines and `tc` the three column lines. `dir` names the
  // reading order, so "right"/"down" mean the first-listed word is the subject
  // of the sentence and "left"/"up" mean the last one is. `verb` is a template:
  // the first word is stated, and each `_` is a word seat filled by the next
  // word in the line, reading order. So row one reads,
  //
  //   OUTLAW hideouts were often raided by a BAND of warriors from a local TRIBE.
  //
  // On the board the sentence is split at its `_` seats and each stretch is
  // written on the wire between the two words it joins, so it reads across the
  // two coloured lines with the middle word seated between them — the same way
  // any other gutter in the game carries its verb between two squares.
  //
  // The board is solved exactly as any other: every square takes a word, the
  // two sentences that pass through it are the two routes in, and once all nine
  // are down the board is closed.
