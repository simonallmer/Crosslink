  title: "A Fire That Learned to Push",
  standfirst: "Twenty-five words and thirty-two connections, and every one of them has a back \u2014 click a connection to turn it over. Eight gutters are bare. One machine sits in the middle and the whole century arranges itself around it.",
  size: 5,
  centre: [2, 2],

  // The second kind of board (E4a), at the largest size the format admits, and
  // built so that the layout itself is the argument. Read it as five bands:
  //
  //   row 0   what is taken out of the ground
  //   row 1   what the ground is turned into
  //   row 2   the machine, with STEAM at the exact centre
  //   row 3   the two things the machine was pointed at — cloth, and distance
  //   row 4   what it cost and what it left behind
  //
  // And as four arms off the centre: the fire to the north, the iron to the
  // west, the railway to the east, the mill and the town to the south. Solve it
  // and you have not learned twenty-five facts, you have learned one shape.
  //
  // Every clue carries its own fact rather than testing for it (E3). The gauze
  // on the lamp, the yard of coal in a mile of seam, the belt from the ceiling,
  // the lip on the wheel, the country agreeing on one clock — a solver who knew
  // none of them can still reach every square, and knows them afterwards. That
  // is the whole argument for the net board: it is not a quiz that happens to be
  // a grid, it is a subject you walk around.
  //
  // The bare eight are bare on purpose. SHAFT to FURNACE, CHIMNEY to ENGINE,
  // LUNG to WHEEL, IRON to COTTON: nothing true and non-trivial joins those
  // pairs, and a gutter filled to make the count is worse than a gutter left
  // open. (D4's ceiling stopped being a failure at 3.3, so 32 is a choice and
  // not a budget; the bars are here because they say something.)
  //
  // Second faces added at 3.7, to E16b's split rather than a blanket softening:
  //
  //   plainer     most of them - "sends its heat up a" for "will not draw
  //               without a", "is dug down to reach a" for "is sunk straight
  //               down until it meets a"
  //   different   same difficulty, another angle - a CHIMNEY that "stands tall
  //               for no reason but" SMOKE; an ENGINE that "chokes its own
  //               driver in a" TUNNEL rather than blackening its roof
  //   harder      COTTON "is strung as warp across a" LOOM and THREAD "is woven,
  //               warp and weft, into" CLOTH, which are the weaver's words and
  //               are meant to be; a LOOM that "beats each row tight into"
  //               CLOTH is what the reed actually does
  //
  // A solver who turns everything gets an easier board in most places and a
  // technical one in the mill, which is the point: you cannot know in advance
  // what is behind, so turning stays a choice.
