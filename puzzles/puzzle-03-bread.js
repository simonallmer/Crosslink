  // The easiest board in the game on purpose: every word is one you could draw,
  // every connection is one step, and no word is doing a second job.
  //
  // An earlier draft had BREAD and LOAF on the same board — two words for one
  // thing — and made CRUST something bread turns into, which it is not: a crust
  // is part of a loaf, not its successor. Both are gone. So is a knife that was
  // there to be scored with, which meant nothing to anyone who has not watched a
  // baker slash a loaf before it goes in.
  //
  // Second faces added at 3.9. The front of this board is the picture of
  // baking; the back is the WORKING of it, which is a different thing and the
  // reason the turn is worth taking here. Front: yeast lifts dough. Back: yeast
  // eats the sugar in it and breathes gas into it. Front: heat kills yeast.
  // Back: heat gives it one last push first, which is oven spring, and is why a
  // loaf is bigger than the dough that went in.
  //
  //   plainer     DOUGH/LOAF - "is left to rise twice before it is a" says the
  //               step count out loud, which the front does not
  //   different   most of them - a peel, a two-in-the-morning start, an oven
  //               that holds heat after the fire is raked out rather than
  //               making any
  //   harder      BAKER/FLOUR and DOUGH/FLOUR are the trade's own language, the
  //               way the steam board puts the weaver's words in the mill: a
  //               baker really does call every other weight a percentage of the
  //               flour, and dough really does get all its stretch from
  //               protein. CRUST/OVEN wants the cup of water thrown in at the
  //               start, which is the one thing on this board a home baker
  //               tends not to know.
  //
  // The knife stays out (see above) and so does anything needing a thermometer.
  // A back that cannot be pictured has no business on the easiest board.
