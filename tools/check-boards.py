"""Acceptance test for Crosslink boards — the rules of the design spec, §1 and §8.

  E9  no connection names a word that is on its own board
  D1  every word has at least 2 connections
  D2  every word is reachable from the centre by two link-disjoint paths
  D3  the board contains at least one cycle
  D4  10-12 of 12 connections on a 3x3; 28-34 of 40 on a 5x5
  H2  no word is set twice on ONE board (across the game is allowed since 3.9)
  L1  every word has a lexicon, registry or vocabulary entry IN ITS OWN LANGUAGE
